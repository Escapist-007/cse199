# cse199
Repository for "How does social media work" section of CSE 199

The main piece of this repo is ```activity.ipynb```, a self-contained tutorial on playing with the reddit API. 
You'll learn how to create a reddit app and use it to scrape reddit data.
Then, you'll pull down data for a few subreddits and ask:

- What are the most popular subreddits, and how can we tell?
- Can we predict the subreddit that a post was made to based only on the text in the title and description of the submission?

The best part is, you can get started playing with this repo right away! Just click the button below to open up
the notebook on a [Binder notebook](https://mybinder.org/) server - no installation of any kind necessary!  Note - it might take a few seconds to boot up, and ignore the 404 error in the static snapshot while its loading!

Please let me know if you have issues or want something clarified, I'm hoping to improve this tutorial!
